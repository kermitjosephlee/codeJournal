Spent all day yesterday driving to see K in CT. Didn't get much done but I was reading through some coding books last night before bed. It helped to get a gauge of where I am in terms of my coding abilities and to learn a couple of new perspectives on coding.

More than anything, I am going to push through the Gatsby blog setup and have that as my github pages site and the resume to be my domain.
