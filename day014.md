The past couple of days have kept me away from coding. I've been taking some shifts at the cafe to cover some scheduling gaps. Working the cafe shifts have really done an number on my sleep schedule and my energy after the shifts. I feel really tired and I find myself not in a position to code effectively.

I did get to sit down with a potential employer. A small startup building tools for franchise restaurants to manage their business and employees. I should be hearing from them over the weekend about maybe taking their technical challenge.

I was going to be heading down to CT today but I was feeling really tired, so I decided to clean up my place and head down tomorrow.

As for coding, I think I'll get in some code wars or cracking the coding interview problems after dinner before going to bed.
