# Day 004
## Dec 6, 2018

Finally wrapped up things with [ascii-sports](https://github.com/kermitjosephlee/ascii-sports). It's in a good place now, just have to start debugging while games are on but I'm happy that it is rendering a resolved promise. Rendering it within a table and with colored text.

Still not totally comfortable with promises but after A's tutorial today, it is little bit more clear. I think my trouble was that in the data flow of my app, I was thinking it is being resolved outside of the promise. So functions were calling on the promise without it being resolved. Conceptually, I was thinking of promises more like a function which in itself is not entirely accurate. It isn't just a list of instructions, it more of a datatype that in is the place of executable instructions.

Need more practice with them but so far, so good

I modular.exported out some functions from the server code. After talking with A about it, they suggested that I spend some time reading and studying prototypes and classes in JS. Something else I've been avoiding but need to tackle. I think I need to start meeting head-on the things I feel I am shying away from, I think the most improvements to my code can be found there.

The issue I'm facing is that I've done an ok job of abstracting out functions to deal with the data. The problem comes when "functions" inside my modular.exports object call upon other "functions" within the m.exports object. It can get a little confusing.

Once I figure this out, I can spin up a Heroku and get the server live.

Next steps are to have a user agent in the server code shoot out html'd strings instead of the raw cli string if it detects something other than cURL.
