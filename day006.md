Stewing about what to do next. Started reading some books about functional programming and competative programming. Does reading about code count as coding? We've been through this before.

Out to do some codewar katas then call it a day. Maybe start the resume personalsite.... We'll see.

Just started resume-site and I'm hoping to build a single page app for my resume to replace the creddle page on my url. I'm still fiddling with what I want to include and what silly features I want to put in to showcase my skills but we'll see.

Some thoughts on create-react-app and github repos. I've been at this for about 6 months and from then I was a complete ham with git and github. Today, I'm better at it but still not silky with executions. Things I have learned from this execution - cloning an empty repo does some weird things. So if I am to start it up again, I should start it with a default empty README.md file so there's something to see in the repo.

There is a lot of junk in the create-react-app in the boilerplate. I'm still not an expert on what I pull out and what is critical but the spinning svg icon is something that can go. Also the c-r-a boilerplates a giant README file which I think they should suffix it is something else, just to not conflict with the repo README.

Look at this... too green to know what I'm doing, but yet I have opinions.
