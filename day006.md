# Day 006
## Dec 8, 2018

Stewing about what to do next. Started reading some books about functional programming and competative programming. Does reading about code count as coding? We've been through this before.

Out to do some codewar katas then call it a day. Maybe start the resume personalsite.... We'll see.
