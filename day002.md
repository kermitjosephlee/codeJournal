# Day 002
## Dec 4, 2018

I pushed through the sleep deprivation and late-night tv watching and actually had a restful night of sleep. Side note, putting on Rachel Maddow podcast really puts me to sleep.

Looking over the [ascii-sports](https://github.com/kermitjosephlee/ascii-sports) code and trying to get the curl get requests to look like how it comes out on my server outputs. The curl get requests are rendering an empty object, so there is something that's coming back too early with an empty promise.

Figured out that the return needs to be a string instead of a series of console.logs. OMG.

Bad luck: found out my car just got towed, so I have to spend time and money dealing with that. Ugh.
