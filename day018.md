So after getting the Gatsby demo working with the code journal, getting it into the proper repo didn't work out as well as I'd hoped. So it seemed easier to just delete the whole project and start from the beginning.

Maybe not the most realistic solution to future projects but it seemed like the best way presently.

Also, after linking the heroku server for ascii-sports to the custom URL - www.asciisports.com, the site works well. Something for future considerations though is to have the code automatically differenticate between regular season and playoffs from the JSON Package that comes back.

Applied to some jobs today too. After getting over some impostor syndrome feelings.
