# Day 011

I've been in a funk lately and have been sad about having my streak broken. But I'm back at it and trying not to think about the symbolism of the broken streak. Just getting back at it.

I bought a domain for a friend for their birthday just to have a static site, maybe even in plain html and have it say happy birthday. So I have just a little over two hours to get this up and running.

Today I learned that deploying to Heroku isn't as simple as one would think. I had built a small static site with some css but no real need for JS and the heroku service was looking for a way to hook into npm start to fire up a node server or something. I ended up using netify which I'm not convinced it's not harvesting some of my github data for something possibly sinister, but they did make it easy to get it up and running on one of their url's. Still need to hook in or forward Syd's URL to the site.

There was talk of using the URL to host the blog of Syd's cross-country bike trip. But a lot of that is still TBD. In the end, the URL plus static site with puppy photo went over very well.
