# Day 011
# Dec 16, 2018

I've been in a funk lately and have been sad about having my streak broken. But I'm back at it and trying not to think about the symbolism of the broken streak. Just getting back at it.

I bought a domain for a friend for their birthday just to have a static site, maybe even in plain html and have it say happy birthday. So I have just a little over two hours to get this up and running.
