# Day 003

Got the methods to return strings and not just print out the logs but the code is just returning promises and not the actual strings. Not quite sure where the hang ups are. Will be deep in some rubber ducking sessions.

I did finally get everything over from moment.js to date-fns which just took two methods. I'm happy with the results. May need some future testing but so far so good.

Did some more testing and realized that the date-fns started the week on Sunday. I'm not entirely clear on ISO year/week setting but instead of counting the weeks, I instead count the days divide by 7, add 0.5, then round up to force a proper week start on Wednesdays. Very hacky but it works for now. Will need to look over the functions to make a more elegant solution but for now, I can live with this.

The great joy of date-fns over moment.js is just taking exactly what I need and leaving the rest. I've never did any tree-shaking before so I think this will be a good learning experience.

I'm realizing that something in happening with the asynchronicity of this project that I have to get a handle on. Things are coming back as unresolved promises or undefined and it's getting to be annoying. So to make sure it wasn't the API call, I dropped in a static JSON object into the env folder and got that to console.log in the server. This way when I send it around the file, the functions will at least be returning what I would hope they would.

Getting my head around what needs time to resolve as a promise and what can be done "instantly" on the server side I thought was just a matter of waiting for an external API needing time (aka. promise) and the rest not needing that delay. But after asking for help and the best response was to read up and watch videos on promises and async/await, I'm finding that this might be all on me to figure out.

I didn't want to spend THIS much time on this but it seems that it wasn't as trivial to move from console.logging strings to having functions handle returned strings and pass them on to the endpoint. Not trivial at all. Blergh

Re-wrote the promises as a fetch and chained the .then's to work the json. It is almost there but it's getting late..
