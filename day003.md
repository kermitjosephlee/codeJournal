Got the methods to return strings and not just print out the logs but the code is just returning promises and not the actual strings. Not quite sure where the hang ups are. Will be deep in some rubber ducking sessions.

I did finally get everything over from moment.js to date-fns which just took two methods. I'm happy with the results. May need some future testing but so far so good.
