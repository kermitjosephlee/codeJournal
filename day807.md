It's been a while and truthfully, I forgot this repo existed until I started to
clean out my repos. Looking over my Readme list of things I wanted to
accomplish, I think my time at FlipGive pretty much took care of the bulk of
them. I'll update them later.

But it also only showed how much further I have to go and that's exciting.

Right now, I'm looking for work again, but it doesn't feel so daunting because
I have a better handle on what people are looking for and better able to
demonstrate my abilities.

Tough days at the office ahead.
