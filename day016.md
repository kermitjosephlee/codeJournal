# Day016
## Dec 28, 2018

Spent all day yesterday with the in-laws and went to dinner and a movie after spending the afternoon with the cats and chatting. Didn't get home until 8-ish and went straight to bed. But I'm sitting in front of the computer and pulled out the monitor for dual display. Got my diet cokes and ready to go. More to report later.
