TIL - stateless React components need a return () but not a render. After writing this down, it makes sense that it doesn't need a render because it isn't a component, just a straight function that returns some JSX.

Spent the morning updating resumes and applying to jobs online. Also confirmed a senior dev mentor tech interview training.

Did some work on the resume site and thinking of some fun things to do with Syd's site too. Got called into work early tomorrow, so I'll be shutting it down early to get to bed early.

Did some code wars too.
