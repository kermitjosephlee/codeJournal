Had a productive weekend morning and jumped on tasks early. Went through the Gatsby tutorial again and got something more from the experience. Migrating the journal entries over to the github pages folder.

Things I learned today:

- GraphQL is amazing and follows better how I think about data - more along the lines of JS objects like JSON instead of SQL. I'm a well aware that there is no way that GraphQL will overshadow SQL so with lots of other things, we'll have to learn both.

- Gatsby is awesome. The tutorial was well constructed. At time of writing, the gatsby-cli tool does a lot to create boilerplate. And it doesn't quite line up with the tutorial 100%. The tutorial will hopefully be updated but as a project on whole, it's well documented.
