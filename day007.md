#Day 007

## Dec 9, 2018

A full week. Wow. Um. Ok. So that's a thing. I started resume-site and listed out the reasons why I'm writing it and the things I want it to have. I had be rolling it around my head for a bit and I think the issues I was having on starting was deciding what to include, what to reach for, what to not include. And it all sounds basic but I have found it helpful to know where the limits are and push towards what it should be instead of what it could be.

Coffee helps. I was never a regular drinker because I probably went a little too hard and got jittery, but when you dial it in just right... so many things can get done.
