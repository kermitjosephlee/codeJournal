# Day 008
## Dec 10, 2018

Spent the whole day at the cafe today to earn that rent money. This holiday season was not how I pictured it but I'm just trying to move forward.

I took a nap and then read a little about mongodb on top of graphql. Maybe getting a little ahead of myself but I do want to review all my options before rebuilding pitcrew. Mongo might be the way to go.

I looked at my resume-site project and wasn't entirely clear on whether I had to install bootstrap after installing react-bootstrap. I did some testing with the button element, and it didn't render properly. It looked like the standard grey HTML button which was not what I wanted.

After reading some unclear documentation and looking at some medium articles, the thing I was missing was the link tag pointing at the cdn of react-bootstrap. So I took out the dependcies in the package.json, deleted the package-lock and rebuilt the dependcies.

I have a meeting with Dave at LHL tomorrow at noon about my technical interviews. I'm going to be waking up early and working on the resume-site project.
