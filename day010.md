# Day 010
## Dec 12, 2018

An off day. Got going by 4pm and not feeling it. Still trying to get Gatsby - Github pages going. Couldn't get out of bed today. I get into these low-energy modes where I feel like I get trapped in a circle of "everything is hard", "so don't do anything". Where all I really need is a reason to get up and just make breakfast, and hit the shower.

I had a pickup basketball game this evening, and after that and eating dinner, everything seems possible. I realize that the my "morning" brain is just needing some food to kick itself out of the low-energy power-save mode but that sometimes feels like a bridge too far. After days like these, I then get into a state where I feel guilty of not being productive.

I sound like an addict trying to kick a habit, but I'm going to try to get up early, have breakfast, exercise, shower, and hit the code hole before 9am.

I just never liked mornings.
