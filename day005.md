# Day 005
## Dec 7, 2018

I hope my daily entries don't seem so - mundane. I just arrive at the end of a day to reflect and it tends to be things I physically go through. Sharing thoughts on this internet accessible platform might be a bridge too far. Or maybe I just have to get to know you a bit better before opening up. I haven't read the end user agreement for GitHub, so for all I know, Microsoft will end up owning all of this anyway.

I woke up today very early (for me at least) and couldn't go back to sleep. So I fired up the ol' morning routine and got to sit in front of the computer to get to work on something. I had wrapped up ascii-sports to a nice chapter ending yesterday night. I had to fix some bugs with heroku's handing of time and split the repos so they are not identical - something I didn't think I'd be annoyed by, but somehow I am.

I sat to write some animation code but I couldn't find it within me to get it going for fear of breaking code. It was probably rooted in my lack of understanding of the code base or maybe just my old friend insecurity coming around to check in. I didn't have the courage to start messing around and fixing my own shit. I felt good for finishing something I set out to do and I wanted to bask in that glow for a little while longer.

I also had my afternoon blocked off to work my old retail job to keep the ends meeting. Everything seems daunting and it's hard to get momentum started. Thinking about it seems like I'm getting somewhere but I know it isn't.

So I ended up reading some stuff about classes, prototypes, and inheritance in JS - it kinda makes some sense but I think I'll need to play around with it before I can really use it confidently. I also opened up some SQL exercises and realized that I haven't made an SQL query in months.

In the end, I think today will have to go into the off-day column. Did I spend an hour or more on code? It consumes a lot of my thought-cycles, so I would say yes. Did I spend an hour or more writing code? No.

In the writing of this, is the take-away spend more time coding and less time thinking about code?
