Took some time off for the holidays. There were some crazy things that happened over the holidays. My car broke down and eventually scrapped on the way back from Connecticut. Thankfully, it happened close to home and I have great friends who came at a moment's notice to come bail me out.

The other crazy thing was my sister's cafe was broken into and robbed. She was out of town at the time, so I stepped in to deal with the police and get the cafe back up and running again.

I finally connected my asciisports.com URL to the heroku server so now I can make curl requests to the custom asciisports.com

Now going through the Gatsby project and make that go live too.

I goofed up the repo transfering. So I deleted the folders and repo and I'm starting over. Hopefully, this one works out better.
