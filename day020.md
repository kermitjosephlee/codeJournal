Spent some time trying to deploy the github pages site with gatsby using gh-pages. What I didn't understand is that the gh-pages deploy script flattens the gatsby structure, makes a new git branch and make a muck of things. I was hoping it wouldn't be so transformative and aggressive in it's changing of things.

So today, I'm hoping to figure out a better system so I am able to write blog entries and have them render properly on the github pages site. Also need to fill out the About and Contact pages of the site as well.

S from LHL came through big with some great leads to positions. Let's see what comes of them. *fingers crossed*
