Working throught the Gatsby tutorial. I also had my remote Senior Dev flake out on our technical test tutorial.

In the Gatsby tutorial, there's an introduction to typography.js - a design layout theme packages for blogs.

I was called into the cafe late last night to open this morning. I tend to get anxious from the fear of oversleeping. It kept me up all night and I ended up not sleeping last night. I was up and moving at 430am and got into work at 6am. Worked my shift and crashed when I got home. So I got my hour of coding in from some katas in codewars.

I also got word that a small startup wants to have a meet and greet later this week. Time to read up on code interviews and more codewars.
