# Day 001
## Dec 3, 2018

I didn't get much sleep last night but I'm trying to break the sleep schedule I'm on which would be to sleep the morning away. It helped that I had breakfast and coffee this morning - it made for a less cranky and whiney brain.

Hopped on some projects by pulling the latest code but I think because of production issues, I couldn't build on a stable local server build. I just popped a message to the appropriate people and waiting for a reply of how best to proceed.

While that was cooking, I got some great feedback from some people I shared this journaling project with. So far the feedback has been positive and the notes that were shared were constructive ones. One suggestion was to make a React/Gatsby app that would be a more public-facing version of this project.

I'll be honest, I wasn't too enthusiatic about learning a new framework/system/whatever that in theory would make my life easier, but in so doing would introduce yet another learning curve. I have enough curves to juggle as it is. At least that was the opening thought. After doing some reading and feeding and caffeinating cranky Joe, Gatsby is looks promising.

Since being held in the waiting pattern, I remembered that I made a commitment to at least one kata on codewars a day. After it was all said and done, I ended up doing four. There's something about those small puzzles that are so fun. It was getting me into better habits like breaking things down into smaller pieces of logic, naming functions and variables verbose and obvious names, debugging. I got reacquanted with some old friends like Array.split(), sorting functions, objects, for...in. Basics, but it is really amazing how rusty one can get when away from the basics. 

One had some recursion as a solution and I'll have to admit that I'm not as strong as I would like to be in making recursive solutions. I can see the elegance in them, but most times it melts my brain on the things I have to check off in building them so they actually work and not make a infinite loop or return something undefined.

It's almost 3pm. Time for lunch and maybe a walk. Then back to React tutorials or messing around with Gatsby.
