# codeJournal

## Dec 2, 2018:

I read somewhere once that people who keep a journal tend to have more bandwidth to do the things they keep wanting to do simply because the act of writing it down allows the brain to forget about it without worrying about remembering those things. It also allows for a way to keep myself honest and to be able to write out those things I'm struggling with and move forward on. This also could be an elaborate way of rubber-ducking.

I was also inspired by the 100 days of coding project and one of the things they encourage is to use Twitter and their hashtag to shout out into the internet to stay accountable.

I am going to pledge to posting a file commit to this repo everyday for 100 days to log my coding journal about things that I am working on. Things that I think I want for myself, to get better as a coder.


So I'll list them out now:

- React in general
- Redux, React Native, React Context, React Hooks, Animating in React
- Better to writing async code in JS in all varieties - promises, async/await, fetching, ajax, ...
- Having a better daily coding routine (breakfast, sit and code, lunch, code, walk, code, basketball, code, sleep before 12a, repeat)
- Building on or re-building PitCrew
- Building a resume site for myself
- Getting more comfortable deploying
- Spending some time on one codewars challenge a day
- Spending some time on SQL questions on hackerrank everyday
- ~~Finishing ascii-sports~~ *Dec 6, 2018*
- Going through old code and either rebuild or archive
- Apply to more jobs && not let shouting into the void get me down
- And to think of these things as directions I want to roll out my dough rather than things I have to achieve

There's a lot more but I'm trying to keep it small and manageable enough. There were strech goals, and I guess I'll write them out now just so that it doesn't take up any more space in my head than necessary:

- Learn Elixir & Phoenix
- Learn Python
- Learn GraphQL
- That unnamed forecasting evaluator project

That should be enough to get started.

If you have any feedback or just want to check in, just make a GitHub issue - let's see how that works out for now.

Thanks for reading
