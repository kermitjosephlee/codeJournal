# codeJournal

## Feb 16, 2021:

Lots has changed since my first initial readme post. And as I can tell, writing isn't a daily habit that's I've formed. It's always been something that I've wanted to do but hasn't really stuck. Blocking off time for writing has never been something I've looked forward to and reading back stuff from the past makes those entries make me feel myopic and petty to myself.

What I did find useful is seeing a list from 2 years ago and seeing how what I wanted to learn came to be. So in that spirit, I'll try to keep the oversharing bits out and try to add in more of the stuff I'm learning in. Here is my updated list:

#### Core Competancies

- Ruby on Rails

  - [ ] writing it
  - [ ] testing it
  - [ ] building GraphQL APIs with it

- [ ] SQL - doing codeWars/hackerRank exercises

- React

  - animations
  - hooks
    - [ ] building custom hooks
    - [ ] useReducer
  - [ ] Redux

- [ ] Form handling

- Serverless
  - [ ] Auth
  - [ ] intro to serverless

#### Projects

- Beer Market

  - keep it simple with React on Node
  - add in webSockets
  - make it again in RoR
  - Auth
  - dashboard
  - mobile

- Grain Feeder

  - mvp: auction site

- Slack standup plugin

- Pitcrew rebuild

#### Stretch Goals

- Elixir / Phoenix
- Golang
- WASM

## Dec 2, 2018:

I read somewhere once that people who keep a journal tend to have more bandwidth to do the things they keep wanting to do simply because the act of writing it down allows the brain to forget about it without worrying about remembering those things. It also allows for a way to keep myself honest and to be able to write out those things I'm struggling with and move forward on. This also could be an elaborate way of rubber-ducking.

I am going to pledge to posting a file commit to this repo everyday for 100 days to log my coding journal about things that I am working on. Things that I think I want for myself, to get better as a coder.

(annotations made current as of Feb 18, 2021)

- React in general _yep_
- Redux, React Native, React Context, React Hooks, Animating in React _getting comfortable_
- Better to writing async code in JS in all varieties - promises, async/await, fetching, ajax _getting comfortable_
- Having a better daily coding routine (breakfast, sit and code, lunch, code, walk, code, basketball, code, sleep before 12a, repeat) _getting better_
- Building on or re-building PitCrew _could, but there are more current projects I want to work on_
- ~~Building a resume site for myself~~ _done_
- Getting more comfortable deploying _better, not super great, heroku and netlify made it easier_
- Spending some time on one codewars challenge a day _still a great idea_
- Spending some time on SQL questions on hackerrank everyday _still a great idea_
- ~~Finishing ascii-sports~~ _Dec 6, 2018_
- Going through old code and either rebuild or archive _ditching older repos_
- Apply to more jobs && not let shouting into the void get me down _back to this, not too bad this time around_
- And to think of these things as directions I want to roll out my dough rather than things I have to achieve _classic overthinking and oversharing_

There's a lot more but I'm trying to keep it small and manageable enough. There were strech goals, and I guess I'll write them out now just so that it doesn't take up any more space in my head than necessary:

- Learn Elixir & Phoenix _still a stretch goal_
- Learn Python _less so of a stretch goal_
- Learn GraphQL _comfortable_
- ~~That unnamed forecasting evaluator project~~ _don't remember what this was_
