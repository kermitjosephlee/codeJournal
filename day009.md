Sat down with Dave from LHL and got to talking about the tech interview questions I was getting and approaching them better. He was very encouraging and empathetic. He did suggest I read up on something and encouraged me to re-write pitcrew. It stood out to him as something that could have legs.

He pointed out a lot of things to read up on, but the big take away was that I'm on the right track and I have to keep building things a keep putting myself out there. The resume site was a good step forward and to keep up on advent of code and codewars katas.

So before the end of the week, I want to get the resume site up and running. I also want to decide on a stack for pitcrew. I've been looking into dusting off the express-postgres server we used for the final project. But I've also been thinking of express-mongo for ease of prototyping. If I need bigger, more robust capabilities, then postgres makes sense. But maybe this is just my being uncomfortable working in SQL.

I'm slowly making the switch to VS Code as a text editor to work in. I like Atom but it can get a little slow once all the expansion packages do their magic in bigger projects. VS Code so far has been great at incorporating all the little packages I like while coding while being responsive. In truth, a big reason for changing was to have quokka support without being deadly slow. We'll see if it was worth the change. For now, they'll still live next to each other in the dock.

I started looking into installing Jekyll and after reading the docs, I've decided to build the blog with Gatsby. Now the question is to either build the resume site separate from the blog site or to put one on top of the other, resume on blog. There is no wrong answer but I hope to make a decision early enough to either frame it out by tomorrow and start something so it can go live by this weekend.
